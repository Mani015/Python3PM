# Operators : Operators are commonly used in programming language
# Operators are special type of symbols, these performs do a specific  operation on  two or more Operands(values) then it return result.

# There are seven types of Operators :
# 1.Arithematic Operator
# 2. Assignment Operator
# 3. Relational Operator
# 4. Logical Operator
# 5. Membership Operator
# 6. Identity Operator
# 7. Bitwise Operator


# 1.Arithematic Operator
# Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication, Division, Floor Division,Moduls, Exponentiation
# syntax : Operand1  + Operand2
#  + is a operator
# Addining two or more Operands
v1 = 10
v2 = 12
print( v1 + v2)  # 22

# Subtraction(-) : Difference between two values
print(v2 - v1)
# 2

# Multiplication :  * Asterik
x1 = 5
x2 = 10
print(x1 * x2)
# 50

# Division(/) :  Dividing the value (Division takes co-eficient value in floating )
print(x2/x1)

print(12/6)

# Floor Division(//) : Takes  co-eficient value but it ignores floating value

print(x2//x1)
# 2


# Modules(%) :  Takes a Remainder value
print(24%8)
# 0

print(56%7)
# 0

# Exponentiation (**) : Power of N
print(4 ** 2)
# 16
print(5**3)
# 125
